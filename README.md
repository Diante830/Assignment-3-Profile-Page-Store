# **Personal Graphic Design Store**

## **Overview**

This project is a personal profile page designed to showcase and sell my own graphic design projects. It includes a selection of journals, tote bags, and t-shirts that I have personally designed. Built using React Next.js, this page will serve as an online portfolio and store, where potential buyers can view and purchase my creations.

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to build an interactive, visually appealing profile page that highlights my personal graphic design work. Each product will have details like images, descriptions, sizes, and pricing. This project also serves as an online store where you can showcase and sell my designs to an audience.

## **Key Features**

- **Landing Page**: Introducing my personal design brand, with a brief bio and the story behind the designs.

- **Product Details**: Each product will have a dedicated page showing detailed images, descriptions, prices, and size options.
